## Git vs. GitHub
* #### **_Git_**:  
Git is a software that runs in the command line. Git takes a snapshot of code that you write so you can look back at it. Git also allows you to send things up to your remote repository (the cloud) and to pull it back down. 
* #### **_Github_**:  
GitHub is a web-based git respotory hosting service, you may often hear this being referd to as the cloud. Github is different to git beause you will always need git for github but you may not always need github for git. Github is an amayzing tool because it provides a easy way to colaborate your code with someone else. Because it is on the internet anyone can see it and pull it down to their local repository so that they can make changes to it that you have the ability to accept or deny.

## Initial Setup
Now that you know the basic idea of git and github, its time to put them into use. The first thing that we need to do is make our first repository. Before we can do that though we need to go into our directory.

1). To get into any directory or repository we have `cd` into it we use a tilde (~) to tell the computer anywhere you are, go into the directory that I am telling you to go in. For example, if I choose to make my first repo in the directory workspace, I would type in this: `cd ~/workspace`. 

2). Now that we are in our directory, we can make our first repo. to make a repository you first need to make a directory. type the code `mkdir` then then name you want your directory (or soon to be repository) to be called. in this example I'll call this first-repo. So I would type `mkdir first-repo` 

3).
